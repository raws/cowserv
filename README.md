CowServ is a Sinatra-powered web service which exposes the wonders of [cowsay](http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml) to the world.

### Usage

CowServ requires that version 3.03 or higher of `cowsay` be available. Your package manager probably has a copy ready to go. You'll also need [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

Start the service using `ruby cowserv.rb` or your preferred Sinatra deployment option.

Send a `GET` or `POST` request to CowServ with a `message` parameter:

    $ curl http://localhost:9876/?message=Hello%20world!
     ______________ 
    < Hello world! >
     -------------- 
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

You may also use many of the standard cowsay command-line switches:

    $ curl http://localhost:9876/?W=10&b&T=U&message=Hello%20world!
     ________ 
    / Hello  \
    \ world! /
     -------- 
            \   ^__^
             \  (==)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                 U ||----w |
                    ||     ||

The allowed switches are, in no particular order: `f, b, d, g, p, s, t, w, y, e, T` and `W`. See the [cowsay man page](http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/cowsay) for details.

#### Cowfiles

For a list of currently-available cowfiles, visit `http://localhost:9876/list`. These cowfiles can be used with the `f` switch.
